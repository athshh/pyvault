# pyvault
Password manager, encrypted notepad and easy file encryption. 

Features implemented so far:
- [X] Encryption module
- [ ] Password management
- [ ] File management
- [ ] Notepad
- [ ] API

Features planned:
1. Front-end UI
2. Custom (probably insecure) encryption algorithm
3. Proper file vault (rather than just file encryption. Similar to Obsidian.)
